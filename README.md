# Quantum-wavelet-transformation
By extending classical wavelet transforms, QWT efficiently extracts relevant frequency information from images, demonstrating substantial benefits for image denoising. The integration of NEQR, an enhanced quantum image representation model, further optimizes storage and computational efficiency.
